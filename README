Are you tired of writing onmouseover= and onmouseout= for hover states?

How to use: Include Prototype or jQuery and this file. Add "will_hover" 
class to any IMG tag that you want to have a hover state. Name hover state 
graphics with "-hover" at the end of the file name. Like "about.png" and 
"about-hover.png".

New bonus feature! Add "will_hover_bg" class to any element with a CSS
background image that you want to have a hover state. Name the graphics
following the convention shown above.
